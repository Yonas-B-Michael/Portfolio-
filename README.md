## Projects
### Automated Grain Storage House
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Senior Research Project: It is a system that uses a microcontroller to control the environment inside a grain storage house. The system typically includes sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels, as well as fans or heaters to adjust the environmental conditions as needed. The Project also include an LCD display to allow the user to monitor the environmental conditions and adjust if needed. Additionally, the system can be configured to send alerts or notifications if there are any changes in the environmental conditions that could potentially damage the grain.
Overall, an automated grain storage house with an Arduino microprocessor provides a cost-effective and efficient solution for monitoring and controlling the environment inside a grain storage house, which can help to prevent spoilage and maintain the quality of the grain over time.
